     *  (straddling* buckets), and never more than the straddling row contributed.
     *  Idle (parking drain) rows are zero-km trips written by HistoryImporter —
     *  their kWh/cost is inside the totals; the idle bucket only splits it out for
     *  display. Only driving rows are counted in straddling buckets: corrections always
     *  describe driving sessions, never idle drain.
     *  Landed-session buckets (landedSession*) = driving rows already written to Room
     *  for the current live session (start_ts >= :sessionStart). The live contribution
     *  in compute() is treated as the not-yet-landed remainder: live - landedSession,
     *  clamped >= 0. This prevents double-counting when TripRecorder closes a trip at
     *  the DRIVE->ACC transition while the live session is still active (powerState >= 1).
     *  Window integrity is guaranteed by the TrackingService liveWholeSession flag: when
     *  the flag is false the counter suppresses live km/kWh entirely (Room-only mode).
